        You will choose an assignment that will help make this #BestCourseAtUofT for you! What can you do that will advance your #PersonalAndProfessionalGoals? 
        For this assignment, we'd like you to create a project to help you advance your #PersonalAndProfessionalGoals. Some examples of what you can do include:
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Apply HCI principles to exploring new software that you and others might find helpful. For example, by giving reminders to do homework for reflections. Past students have done this with Notion, Otter, and Figma.</li>
            <li>Applying an HCI approach to preparing for job interviews, finding jobs, building a portfolio, improving your LinkedIn profile, and making LinkedIn posts
            </li>
            <li>Design a Digital Learning Resource to learn about a topic you care about relating to HCI</li>
        </ol>
        The deliverable for this assignment is a GDoc outlining:

        <ol type="1">
            <li>What topic you chose
            </li>
            <li>Why you chose that topic
            </li>
            <li>Your project</li>
            <li>A 1-page reflection on your work, including what you learned by completing this project
            </li>
         </ol>

        <bold>We suggest working independently on this assignment, or in a group of up to three students. </bold>
        #EstimateYourGrade: You will submit an estimate of your own grade, and explain what you learned from this. How did this assignment help in some small way to make this #BestCourseAtUofT, because of what *you* learned that will help you in the future, or that you were excited about?
