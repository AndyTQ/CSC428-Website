    <p>
        You will choose an assignment that will help make this #BestCourseAtUofT for you! What can you do that will advance your #PersonalAndProfessionalGoals? 
        For this assignment, we'd like you to create a project to help you advance your #PersonalAndProfessionalGoals. Some examples of what you can do include:
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Apply HCI principles to exploring new software that you and others might find helpful. For example, by giving reminders to do homework for reflections. Past students have done this with Notion, Otter, and Figma.</li>
            <li>Applying an HCI approach to preparing for job interviews, finding jobs, building a portfolio, improving your LinkedIn profile, and making LinkedIn posts
            </li>
            <li>Design a Digital Learning Resource to learn about a topic you care about relating to HCI</li>
        </ol>
        The deliverable for this assignment is a GDoc outlining:

        <ol type="1">
            <li>What topic you chose
            </li>
            <li>Why you chose that topic
            </li>
            <li>Your project</li>
            <li>A 1-page reflection on your work, including what you learned by completing this project
            </li>
         </ol>

        <bold>We suggest working independently on this assignment, or in a group of up to three students. </bold>
        #EstimateYourGrade: You will submit an estimate of your own grade, and explain what you learned from this. How did this assignment help in some small way to make this #BestCourseAtUofT, because of what *you* learned that will help you in the future, or that you were excited about?
         <br>
         <br>
        <mark>Please submit by: March 10-19 - <a href="https://tiny.cc/hctracker">https://tiny.cc/hctracker</a></mark>

    <!-- Assignment 1 content -->
    <h2 class="sectionTitle" id="A1">Assignment 1: Designer Mindset + MentalWellbeing + User Interviews</h2>
    <p>
        The Assignment is intended to give you an opportunity to put into practice what you have been learning, and review key concepts. Your main task is to investigate and enhance the design of a digital activity to help people manage stress. Your job is to test it out and provide some alternatives to its design and delivery, based on applying a #DesignerMindset (Week 3, tiny.cc/chapterdesign), the work on Mental Wellbeing (Week 4), and collecting data about user needs and feedback (Week 5, User Interviews).
        <br>
        <br>
        Examples of past assignments are under the Submission section at the end of the document: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_06wdqVoXHRCVeuJTSiQ9aT45WtOfzBlBAM9sWWtwKo/edit#">Spring 2022 Submissions</a> The links work better if you view the document in Google docs.
        <br>
        <br>
        List your team members, indicate if you are looking for a team, and provide links to your submissions at Spring 2023. Also indicate there how you #SetOwnTargetAndDeadline.
        <br>
        <br>
        What you will submit
        <br>
        You will submit a 3-6 page (or longer) 'report' that explains:
        <ol type="1">
            <li>What you learned from this assignment in terms of HCI skills</li>
            <li>What you did, and why you made those decisions</li>
            <li>What process you followed</li>
            <li>What activities you engaged in</li>
            <li>Why you engaged in those activities</li>
            <li>What novel insights you had
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        You can choose what format to use, there is only one required section. It should be:
        <ul>
            <li>0.5 to 1 pages (or longer)</li>
            <li>Titled "#Reflection: What I understood better or learned from doing this assignment".</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        This is the most important part of the assignment because it allows you to reflect on what you have understood better and learned, it gives you a chance to explain what knowledge you gained, why you think that was useful, what the evidence is that you gained it.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can be creative here in making it useful for *you*. You are essentially explaining – the same way you would to an employer, or in an interview, or to your research advisor – what it is that you learned, so that it's obvious to them you got a lot out of doing this assignment.
        <br>
        <br>
        Think of this as making your job easier – to demonstrate learning & competence – because you can easily tell us what you learned, very directly.
        <br>
        <br>
        Why might this be useful to you? A range of reasons (you add your own!):
        <ul>
            <li>It allows you all to take different approaches and be creative in how you approach the assignment.</li>
            <li>It allows you to *take charge* of your learning and make sure the assignment is useful *for you*.</li>
            <li>It allows people flexibility, so that anything they already started on and did is still completely useful, they can go ahead and submit it, while also giving them flexibility that any updates to the assignment can let them improve or build upon what they did.</li>
            <li>It gives you *credit* for all the reviewing & revisiting of work that you do.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
